Datasets from Kaggle

Using kaggle API for climeate/ weather data datasets

Explore/Transform data 
- Explored missing values
- standarized the naming of countries across the different data sets (cities and countries)
- reviewed distribtion of quantitative data for the global weather data set
- filtered the global weather data set by years that included more data
- dropped NaN values
- ...

Visualize data
- histogram
- scatter plot
- box plot/violin plot
- area
- line
