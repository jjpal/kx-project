Climate Time Series Analysis
---

Datasets from Kaggle

Using kaggle API for climeate/ weather data datasets

Explore/Transorm data 
- Explored missing values
- copied dataframe for transformations dropping columns not required for analysis
- standarized the naming of countries across the different data sets (cities and countries)
- reviewed distribtion of quantitative data for the global weather data set
- filtered the global weather data set by years that included more data
- dropped NaN values

Visualize data
- histogram
- scatter plot
- horizontal bar
- violin plot / box plot

Time Series Modeling Methods
- Simple Moving Average
- Moving Average (MA)
- Autoregression (AR)
- Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA)
